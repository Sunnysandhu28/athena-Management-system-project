    <!-- Conclusion -->

        <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Following the CQC inspection in January 2025 and subsequent warning notice, Quenby Rest Home has made significant progress in addressing the identified regulatory breaches. The comprehensive improvement programme has resulted in demonstrable enhancements across all regulatory domains, with particularly strong progress in medication management, safeguarding, and staff development areas.</p>
        
        <p>The CQC follow-up inspection in April 2025 confirmed that the requirements of the warning notice had been met, acknowledging the significant improvements made. Internal compliance monitoring indicates current overall compliance of 86% across all regulatory domains, representing substantial progress from the estimated 65% compliance at the time of the original inspection.</p>
        
        <p>The prioritised action plan addresses remaining compliance gaps with clear timelines and responsibilities. Continued focus on these areas will further strengthen regulatory compliance and service quality. The governance framework now in place provides robust oversight and monitoring mechanisms to ensure sustained improvement and early identification of any emerging issues.</p>
        
        <p>The next CQC comprehensive inspection is anticipated in January 2026, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the sustained improvements made and achieve an improved overall rating.</p>
